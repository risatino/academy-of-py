Your final report should include each of the following:

**District Summary**

* Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**School Summary**

* Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

* Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

* Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

**Math Scores by Grade**

* Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Reading Scores by Grade**

* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Scores by School Spending**

* Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**Scores by School Size**

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

**Scores by School Type**

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

As final considerations:

* Your script must work for both data-sets given.
* You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames. 
* You must include an exported markdown version of your Notebook called  `README.md` in your GitHub repository.  
* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. 
* See [Example Solution](PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_Example.pdf) for a reference on the expected format.
