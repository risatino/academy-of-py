### Academy of Py

#### Three trends based on this dataset:

1. School size and score results can have a negative effect on student performance. The larger the number of students, the lower success in grades.

2. The budget per student and spending levels are negatively correlated with scores.

3. Students from Charter schools perform better than students from District schools. The data shows a significant difference with the overall passing rate among students between Charter and District schools. The largest Charter school has much better scores than the smallest District school. This data only takes into consideration large District and small Charter school size so there is probably a discrepancy with the two types of schools.
